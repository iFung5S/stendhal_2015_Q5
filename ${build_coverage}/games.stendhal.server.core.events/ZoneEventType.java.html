			&quot;Screams and wails fill the air of these ghastly catacombs ...&quot;),

			&quot;Your sense of foreboding grows as you enter deeper to the catacombs. You spy some lethal looking spikes and vow to be careful of them.&quot;),
<span class="nc" id="L26">	VISIT_KIKAREUKIN_CAVE(</span>
			&quot;Your head spins as the portal lifts you high into the air, past clouds and birds. You're sucked towards a floating group of islands. You're pulled through layers of rock and finally you land in a vast network of caves.&quot;),
<span class="nc" id="L28">	VISIT_KANMARARN_PRISON(</span>
			&quot;PRISON BREAKOUT! You've stumbled into a heist. It looks like the duergars have come to break their leaders and heroes free from their imprisonment by the dwarves.&quot;),

			&quot;You now sense a strong magical presence. Perhaps sorcerers are nearby, or some strong enchantments?&quot;),

			&quot;The ground in this cave trembles from the footfalls of GIANTS! The weak should explore no further here. Turn around and run away!&quot;),
<span class="nc" id="L38">	VISIT_ADOS_CASTLE(</span>
			  &quot;You sense that great atrocities have happened here. The castle must be overrun with evil creatures, as the sounds of their last victims ring in your ears. It may be wise to stay away.&quot;);
